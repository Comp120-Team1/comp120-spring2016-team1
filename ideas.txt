- Add map / heat map functionality
- Store hash algorithm in addition to salt & hashed password
- Store attachment (with) in separate table - each photo with a corresponding
  incident ID
- Add 'use my location' option to the location field
- A lot of people asked about 'what if this is an emergency?' Maybe we should
  put a little notice at the top of the incident form just being like "if this
  is an emergency call 911..."
- Question: what if inputter doesn't know which department should handle the
  incident?
- If possible, maybe a way of keeping track of status/edits so we can make a
  timeline / revert to a previous version of an incident if necessary.
- Add resolve_time field to incidents table
- What if a person is in multiple departments?
- use FOREIGN KEY option in tables when a column is a key from another table
- use the cool google captcha on our form (google.com/recaptcha)
- Photos:
	- If someone is using a phone, option to take a photo right there and
	  add it to the form
	- If someone is using a computer, they can upload, but it might be
	  easier for them to snap a pic from their phone and somehow attach the
	  photo to the incident. Maybe something like "text a photo to
	  (781) 555-1234" and if we get our server gets a text from a phone
	  number thats in the database, we add that photo to that person's
	  recent incident report
- Show count numbers in the incident list - so if someone searches "tweety
  bird" it could be like 'showing 20 of 241' so they can see how many total
  matches there are
- Somehow incorporate tags into incident reporting. Either tags that we come up
  with or tags the user can put it (and could get suggestions from previous
  tags)
